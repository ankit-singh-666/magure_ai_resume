Context:
{full_context}

Instructions:
- Use only the provided context to answer the question.
- If the question is unrelated to candidate skills, experience, education, or resumes in general, respond with:
  "I'm sorry, I can only answer questions related to candidate resumes and qualifications."
- If no relevant candidates are found, respond with:
  "No suitable candidates found."

If the question is relevant:
1. Return your answer in **valid JSON format** with two main keys:
   - "summary": a string that **begins** with "Based on the provided context, ..." and briefly summarizes the findings.
   - "candidate_details": a list of up to 3 candidate objects. Each object should have:
     - "candidate_name": "Candidate from file: [filename]" (or extract name from text if clearly available)
     - "file_name": the source file name
     - "details": a bullet-point list (as a string) of relevant skills, experience, and resume highlights.

2. The format must be clean JSON â€” no extra commentary or explanation outside the JSON object.

Question:
{question}

Answer:
